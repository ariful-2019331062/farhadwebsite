                <p><i>Makes 1 (9-inch) tart</i></p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 sleeves Ritz crackers (about 7.5 ounces or 1 3/4 cup crushed crackers)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1 large egg white</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
                    <li>Add crackers to bowl of food processor. Process until crackers are a fine crumb. Add Parmesan cheese,<br> melted butter, egg white and 1/2 teaspoon kosher      salt. Process until evenly combined and mixture holds<br> together when pressed between fingers. If it doesn’t hold together, add an additional tablespoon of    melted butter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Tightly press mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Tip: If the crust<br> is not packed tightly, it will crumble when         sliced. Use the back of a measuring cup to help<br> really pack it down, as seen <a href ="#"><i>here</i></a>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place tart pan on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside and<br> cool completely. Then place in fridge for one hour      to help crust set.
                    </li>
                </ol>
