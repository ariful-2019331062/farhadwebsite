            <p style="color: seagreen;">What better way to celebrate tomato season than with a recipe highlighting summer’s
                finest offering? Heirloom tomatoes are gorgeous, juicy, come in a rainbow of

                colors and are packed full of delicious flavor.
                <span style="color: red;">You might ask if these irregular shaped beauties are actually worth the price tag.</span>
                I paid $8 for a single tomato at a farmers market and complained about it
                the whole way home, but after taking one bite I realized I would have paid $16 for it. And
                here’s why.

                Heirloom tomatoes are the cultivation of heirloom seeds that have been passed down for
                generations in a specific region and are purposely picked by a farmer for their unique
                characteristics. To be considered an heirloom, the seeds need to be at least 50 years old.
                Fifty years ago, tomatoes were grown for their flavor and not necessarily their appearance.
                It didn’t matter if they weren’t perfectly round, were bruised or had thin skins. What mattered
                was whether they tasted good.

                There’s a small window in the summer months to get these guys, so if you see them, pick them
                while you can. Look for tomatoes that are heavy for their size, are slightly firm to the touch,
                and have green stems and minimal abrasions.

                As a recent transplant to Charleston, South Carolina, I’ve become a big fan of Southern cuisine.
                Pimento cheese is king here and is acceptable to eat at breakfast, lunch or dinner. It only seems
                natural to pair together the “paté of the South” with juicy, ripe heirloom tomatoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The base of this tart starts with a Ritz cracker crust consisting of just four ingredients: crackers,
                butter, Parmesan cheese and an egg white. The Parmesan cheese helps bind the crust together while also
                adding a cheesy, salty bite.

                After the tart is baked and cooled, it’s slathered with a generous amount of creamy pimento cheese,
                topped with a variety of gorgeous, ripe and juicy ’looms and garnished with fresh herbs and flaky sea
                salt.

                This is an easy recipe that’s perfect for entertaining on those summer nights or even as the main star
                of any Sunday brunch.

            <h2>Pimento Cheese and Heirloom Tomato Tart with Ritz Cracker Crust</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 sleeves Ritz crackers (about 7.5 ounces or 1 3/4 cup crushed crackers)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>6 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 large egg white</li>
                <li>6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/2 cup good quality mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>3 cups freshly shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1 (4-ounce) jar diced pimentos, drained and diced</li>
                <li>3 or 4 large heirloom tomatoes, sliced</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves and minced chives, to taste</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add crackers to bowl of food processor. Process until crackers are a fine crumb. Add Parmesan
                        cheese, melted butter, egg white and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Process until evenly combined and
                        mixture holds together when pressed between fingers. If it doesn’t hold together, add an
                        additional tablespoon of melted butter.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p> Tightly press mixture into bottom and sides of 9-inch tart pan with removable bottom. Tip: If
                        the crust is not packed tightly, it will crumble when sliced. Use the back of a measuring cup to
                        help really pack it down, as seen here.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <p>Place tart pan on a baking sheet and bake until golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes. Set aside
                        and cool completely. Then place in fridge for one hour to help crust set.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Meanwhile, add tomato slices to paper towel-lined plate. Season with kosher salt and let sit for
                        a few minutes to remove excess moisture.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, garlic powder, apple cider vinegar and 1/2
                        teaspoon kosher salt. Whisk until evenly combined.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Mix together softened cream cheese, mayonnaise, garlic powder, apple cider vinegar and 1/2
                        teaspoon kosher salt. Whisk until evenly combined.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Spread pimento cheese mixture evenly on bottom of chilled tart crust.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Top with sliced tomatoes. Garnish with chives, basil leaves and flaky sea salt. Serve
                        immediately.</p>
                </li>

                <p>When you ask any owner about why they love canines so much, it’s highly likely they will mention the
                    fact that dogs are so loyal.
                    They are always there for us, and many will do absolutely anything for their owner, even try to save
                    them or get help in an emergency.
                    Their loyalty knows no bounds, but why are dogs so loyal? It’s partially because they’ve learned to
                    be over the centuries in their role as our companions.
                    They have come to expect loyalty as being part of their job description.
                    But it’s also because of the bond that humans have built with our doggy friends over time, whether
                    they’re a pedigree show dog, a hound, or a
                    mongrel rescue dog that’s had a rough start - we love our dogs unconditionally. And they start to
                    recognise this. It’s also hard to ignore that fact that dogs will reward us with their loyalty if we give them
                    positive reinforcement like food and walkies and plenty of love.
                    Have you ever noticed how dogs will usually be more loyal and obedient towards whichever family
                    member feeds them? This is no coincidence.
                    Another core reason why pups and pooches are loyal is because it’s built into them.
                    Dogs, like wolves, are pack animals. If you look at wolves in the wild, they’re extremely loyal to
                    their pack and will protect and support them no matter the cost.
                    This is a part of what makes them such expert survival specialists – working together.                  
                    Well, domesticated dogs may have come to see us as their pack in a way, and they protect
                     and support their pack members.
                    Studies have also shown that dogs can feel emotions and experience emotional contagion. 
                    The fact that they grow to adore their owners only further contributes to their devotion and loyalty. 
                    So now that we’ve covered a brief history of dogs and how they potentially came to be at our side, let’s
                     delve into what makes them so amazing and why today’s owners see their pup as their bestest bud in the world.
                     First and foremost, dogs are great company. Even when you’re feeling lonely and down, they’re there, staring back at you with those puppy dog eyes.

                     When you have a dog, you get used to having them around all the time for company, and your house feels so empty without them.
                     
                     Part of the reason why they’re man’s best friend is because they’re quite simply good to have around.</p>
